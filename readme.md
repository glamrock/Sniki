# Sniki ALPHA

Sniki is a group of themes for mediawiki, optimized to be light and low on fluffy bits.  
Sniki is also a fork of mediawiki, which is lighter and faster than standard installations.

## Wait, "Alpha?"
Yup, Alpha. This is a work-in-progress. It's stable *now* BUT will have annoying bugs as things progress further.

## So what's the deal?

Sniki themes are optimized for use with Tor, FreeNet, and i2p hidden services.  Currently, options out there look poor or run extremely slowly.  

By trimming the fat and reducing features in the base wiki software, we can lessen the load on anonymity networks without sacrificing the core features and security that people have come to expect.

## Features on the chopping block

* Image Upload
* IP Logging (there is no banhammer)
* Most languages (languages can be re-added and changed by administrators)
* API support
